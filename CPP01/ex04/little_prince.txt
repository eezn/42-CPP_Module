” Please draw me a sheep… “

When the mystery is too impressive, we do not dare to disobey. As absurd as it seemed to

me a thousand miles from all inhabited places and in danger of death, I took out of my

pocket a sheet of paper and a pen. But I remembered that I had studied geography, history,

calculation and grammar, and I told the little fellow (with a little bad humor) that I did not

know how to draw. He replied,

” It does not matter. Draw me a sheep. “

As I had never drawn a sheep, I thought of him as one of the only two drawings of which I

was capable. That of the boa closed. And I was astounded to hear the little fellow reply:

” No ! No ! I do not want an elephant in a boa. A boa is very dangerous, and an elephant is

very cumbersome. My place is tight. I need a sheep. Draw me a sheep.”
